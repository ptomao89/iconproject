<h1> Flooding Vulnerability of Basement Apartments in New York</h1>



<div class="boxed"> 

<p> Hurricane Ida left behind $50 million worth of damage and claimed the lives of 13 New Yorkers. 11 of the 13 deaths occurred in basement units. Many of the apartments were illegally converted into housing.</p> 

<p>Basement apartments in low lying areas like Gowanus, Brooklyn  are particularly vulberable to flooding. In the Park Slope area alone, up to 1890 basement units are at flood risk.</p>

<p>New state legislation looks to address both unsafe and unlicensed basement housing. The legislation would begin a process to license illegal housing and provide rehabilitation for licensed but unsafe basement units.  </p>

			<p> 53% of New Yorkers pay more that 30% of their income to housing. As New York faces a housing crisis, much of the remaining affordable rental stock available to working class or immigrant populations are found in basement dwellings. The housing shortage and  climate change, lead to the dangerous conditions experienced during Hurricane Ida. Advocates are demanding lawmakers make basement living safer. </p>

			<p>Roughly 50,000-100,000 New Yorkers live in unlicensed basement apartments. Many of these units lack windows and safety measures required by New York City building code. An estimated 30,000 unlicensed basement units are vulnerable to flooding in New York. </p>

				<p>During the pandemic, the mayorâ€™s office cut a $1.2 million pilot program that provided funding to rehab and bring up to code unlicensed basement units. The pilot began in 2018 with the goal of converting 40 East New York basement units into safe, legal housing. Only 8 apartments have been approved for funding and none are yet up to code. <a href=" https://www.thecity.nyc/housing/2021/9/2/22655239/nyc-basement-apartment-storm-deaths-renew-housing-advocates-calls-for-legalization/"> 900 residents expressed interest in the program and 300 applied for fudning. </a>   </p>

				<p>Under current regulatory measures, it could cost roughly $300,000 to convert a basement unit into legal housing. A financial barrier that many small landlords cannot overcome. The Citizens Housing Planning Council has documented the difficulty of complying with city ordinances <a href="https://chpcny.org/basement-apartment-regulatory-checklist/">here.<a>   </p>

				<p>New legislation would provide financing for landlords looking to upgrade or convert  basement units into housing. Additionally, it removes burdensome regulations and extends legal protections to renters living in basements. Rent would be stabilized for current basement renters. <a href="http://nystateassembly.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=8&clip_id=6390"> On Tuesday, the state assembly held a legislative hearing.</a> Supporters are hoping to pass the bills this legisltive session.   </p>
